          <p>
            For the past year I've build projects using HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript. After I felt more than comfortable working with vanilla
            CSS and Js I went further and thought myself how to work more
            efficiently using SASS and React. I would like to work using React
            or any JS framework.

        <span className="vertical-line"></span>
        <TextSection title="About">
          <p>
            In time, I made my own strategy of debugging to maximize the
            learning process. I start by googling the error to see what's
            causing it. If it's a syntax error I search it on MDN and read the
            documentation. If it's something else I would keep looking for
            answers online for one hour. If I cant't find a solution I would ask
            a teacher. With this approach, even if I don't solve an issue I
            still learn new valuable information.
